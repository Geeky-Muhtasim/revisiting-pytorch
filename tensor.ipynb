    "# Tensors\n",
    "Tensors are data structures used to store higher dimensional array designed for mathematical and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimension -> In how many direction data is spanned.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scalars: 0-dimensional tensors (Represents a single value, often used for simple matrics or constants)\n",
    "2. Vectors: 1-dimensional tensors (Represents a sequence or a collection of values, e.g. Feature Vector-each word in a sentence maybe represented as a 1D vector using embeddings)\n",
    "3. Matrics: 2D tensions (Represents tabular or grid like data)\n",
    "4. 3D Tensors: Adds a third dimension, often used for stacking data e.g. RGB images(256X256 - shape: [256,256,3])\n",
    "5. 4D Tensors: Batches of RGB images (Adds the batch size as an additional dimension to 3D data e.g dataset of colored image: (batch size X width X height X channels))\n",
    "6. 5D Tensors: Video Data (Adds a time dimension for data that changes over time e.g, video frames)"
